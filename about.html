		<p> This project was created as part of an intership at Alytaus Kolegija in Lithuania.
		</br>
		We are two students from Lille1 University in France and we created this e-Testing System during our internship.
		</br>
		</br>
		Thanks to our e-Testing System you will be able to create electronic-tests and we will send it automatically to the persons of your choice, then you will receice their answer by e-mail.
		</br>
		</p>
		Our e-tests are protected by a unique token which is randomly generated, also only you and the persons you have choosen can access to your e-test.
		</br>
		</br>
		We hope that you will enjoy our project.
